    "## Storyline and notebook references\n",
    "* The **Layout** algorithm was developed first in [01_explore_layout.ipynb](./01_explore_layout.ipynb).\n",
    "  - At this point, none of the other components existed, so two simple viewers were developed in the notebook itself to visualize results.\n",
    "  - The best of these was later refactored for reusability and placed as a standalone class `ArcViewer` in [static_viewers.py](../idlmav/static_viewers.py) \n",
    "  - For the same reason, some random graph generation functions were developed to provide inputs to the layout algorithm\n",
    "  - The best of these was later refactored for reusability and placed as a standalone function `create_random_sample_graph` in [layout.py](../idlmav/layout.py)\n",
    "  - These reuable components were used during development of some of the other components, but their use gradually faded as better components were developed\n",
    "  - The final layout algorithm was polished and maintained in the `MavLayout` class in [layout.py](../idlmav/layout.py), which is exported via the `layout_graph_nodes` function in the same file\n",
    "  - The notebook [02_test_layout.ipynb](./02_test_layout.ipynb) runs this maintained version of the algorithm to confirm that it is working\n",
    "* The **Rendering** algorithm was developed next in [03_explore_rendering.ipynb](./03_explore_rendering.ipynb)\n",
    "  - During this experiment, two more detailed experiments were performed in [04_explore_plotly_interaction.ipynb](./04_explore_plotly_interaction.ipynb) and [05_explore_js_interaction.ipynb](./05_explore_js_interaction.ipynb) to try out different approaches to interactivity\n",
    "  - No ideal approach was found that would suit all use cases. Therefore, two approaches were settled on to cater for different use cases\n",
    "    - The more interactive approach was implemented in [widget_renderer.py](../idlmav/renderers/widget_renderer.py) and provides the most interactivity, but requires a running back-end or kernel to service JS requests.\n",
    "    - The more portable approach was implemented in [figure_renderer.py](../idlmav/renderers/figure_renderer.py) and creates an output that works well even when browsed on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) without a running back-end\n",
    "  - The notebook [06_test_rendering.ipynb](./06_test_rendering.ipynb) runs the maintained versions of the rendering algorithms to confirm that they are working\n",
    "* The **Tracing** algorithm was developed next in [07_explore_tracing.ipynb](./07_explore_tracing.ipynb)\n",
    "  - During this experiment, a [tutorial by James Reed](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/pull/1319) was copied to [08_fx_profiling_tutorial.ipynb](./08_fx_profiling_tutorial.ipynb) and executed from there to get a better understanding of `torch.fx` and its `Interpreter` class\n",
    "  - The `Interpreter` class from `torch.fx` was experimented with in more detail in [09_explore_fx_interpreter.ipynb](./09_explore_fx_interpreter.ipynb)\n",
    "  - A strategy for tracing was documented in [07_explore_tracing.ipynb](./07_explore_tracing.ipynb), implemented in [tracing.py](../idlmav/tracing.py) and tested in [10_test_tracing.ipynb](./10_test_tracing.ipynb)\n",
    "* The **Coloring** and **Merging** algorithms were implemented last\n",
    "  - These algorithms were simpler and required less iterative experimentation.\n",
    "  - At this point, the IDLMAV solution was working end-to-end, just without coloring and merging.\n",
    "  - For these reasons, they were implemented directly in [coloring.py](../idlmav/coloring.py) and [merging.py](../idlmav/merging.py), respectively\n",
    "  - Some experiments on how to interact with `plotly.colors` were performed in [11_explore_colors.ipynb](./11_explore_colors.ipynb)\n",
    "  - Testing was performed in [12_test_idlmav.ipynb](./12_test_idlmav.ipynb) using the `reload_imports()` function to reload updates to the \".py\" files without restarting the notebook or kernel"
